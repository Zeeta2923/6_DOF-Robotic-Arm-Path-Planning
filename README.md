# 6_DOF-Robotic-Arm-Path-Planning

This project focuses on 6-DOF robotic arm path planning. The 3D modeling was done in SolidWorks, then imported into MATLAB and converted to Simscape Multibody for dynamic simulation. Path planning was implemented by providing the necessary kinematic and dynamic equations. ðŸš€

ðŸ”¹ Softwares Used: SolidWorks, MATLAB, Simscape Multibody
ðŸ”¹ Key Features: 3D modeling, simulation, path planning
